📚 How It Works

- Tkinter manages the window, buttons, and layout.

- AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parses math expressions safely.

- Button grid is created dynamically for digits and operators.

- Custom colors distinguish numbers (dark gray) and operators (orange).

🔮 Future Improvements

- Dark mode toggle 🌙

- Calculation history panel 📜

- Memory buttons (M+, M-, MR, MC) 💾

- Hover effects for modern UI ✨
